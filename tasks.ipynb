    "# Task 1: Binary Representations\n",
    "Manipulating binary representations is done as part of the **Secure Hash Standard (SHS)** algorithms [1]. The [National Institute of Standards and Technology (2015)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) note that the primary reason for these manipulations is to generate 'digests' of messages, which are condensed representations of electronic data [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary function of generating message digests is to verify if messages have remained unaltered since the time the digests were originally created [1]. The algorithms specified in the Standard allow for the identification of the message’s integrity [1]. This occurs because any modification to the message will almost certainly produce a different digest [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **manipulation of binary representations** is the fundamental mechanism by which these hash algorithms operate. The hash computation process involves iteratively generating a series of hash values using a message schedule, functions, constants, and word operations [1]. These word operations are specifically defined binary manipulations that operate on fixed-size groups of bits called \"words\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific operations used to manipulate the binary representations of words include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bitwise logical word operations:** AND, OR, XOR, and complement.\n",
    "- **Addition modulo 2^w:** Where 'w' is the word size (32 or 64 bits, depending on the specific SHA algorithm). This operation is defined by adding the integer values represented by the words and taking the remainder modulo 2^w.\n",
    "- **Left-shift operation (<<):** Obtained by discarding leftmost bits and padding with zeros on the right.\n",
    "- **Right-shift operation (>> or SHR n (x)):** Obtained by discarding rightmost bits and padding with zeros on the left.\n",
    "- **Rotate operations (ROTR/ROTL):** For circular shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These binary manipulations are defined within the functions used by the algorithms, such as the Ch, Maj, Sigma0, and sigma0 functions for SHA-224 and SHA-256, which combine bitwise logic, shifts, and rotations [1].\n",
    "Beyond message integrity, the characteristic where any modification to the message produces a different digest can also facilitate digital signature creation and validation, message authentication code verification, and random number generation [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "The following functions introduce binary operations used in Secure Hash Standard algorithms for message digest creation, providing implementations of the bit manipulation operations that form the foundation of cryptographic hash functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function 1: rotl(x, n=1) (Left Rotation)\n",
    "The ROTL (Rotate Left) operation is fundamental in the SHA-1 algorithm and represents a circular left shift [1]. It performs a shift of x by n positions to the left. The `rotl` function defined below performs a left rotation on a 32-bit unsigned integer. Left rotation shifts bits to the left by `n` positions, wrapping around the bits that overflow beyond the 32-bit boundary. This implementation uses [bitwise shift operators (`<<` and `>>`)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python3-program-to-rotate-bits-of-a-number/) to perform the rotation, combining the left shift with a right shift of the remaining bits.\n",

    "Manipulating hash values is done as part of hash table lookup algorithms [2]. [Kernighan and Ritchie (1988)](https://www.cimat.mx/ciencia_para_jovenes/bachillerato/libros/%5BKernighan-Ritchie%5DThe_C_Programming_Language.pdf) provide an implementation of an algorithm which provides a hash-search, converting a word into a positive integer (hash value) [2].\n",
    "The primary function of this algorithm is to allow for searching within hash tables by using the generated integer as an index [2]. The algorithm serves as the basis for Java's [hashCode()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-string-hashcode-method-with-examples/), which is used to return a String's hash value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `hash` function defined below is a Python version of Kernighan and Ritchie's algorithm, which works by iteratively processing each character in the input string and combining it with previously processed characters in a way that distributes values evenly across the hash table. \n",
    "- [The algorithm uses 31 as a multiplier](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/why-does-javas-hashcode-in-string-use-31-as-a-multiplier/) due to its nature as a prime number, which creates different distributions of keys in the array. When using a prime multiplier, the same key (e.g. \"DEV\") would generate different hash values (e.g. D31 + E31 + V*31) compared to using a non-prime multiplier (e.g. 30), resulting in better distribution of values across the hash table. \n",
    "- [101 is used as the modulo value](https://www.designgurus.io/answers/detail/why-should-hash-functions-use-a-prime-number-modulus) for the hash function because it constrains the output to a fixed range (0-100) that can be directly used as an index in a hash table of size 101. As a prime, 101 has no common factors with other numbers except 1, allowing hash values to spread evenly across all buckets (array slots where elements with the same hash value are stored) rather than clustering in predictable patterns. This helps to reduce collisions and improve overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `hash` function initializes a hash value at 0 and loops through each character of the input string. Using [`ord()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord), each character is converted to an integer, multiplied by 31, and combined with the current hash value. The result is reduced to a fixed range using the modulo operator (101).\n",

The comparative analysis shows that performance varies based on the size of numbers being evaluated [4]. For smaller ranges of numbers, the Sieve of Sundaram demonstrates better performance characteristics than the Sieve of Eratosthenes [4]. However, as the quantity of prime numbers increases or when dealing with larger number ranges, the Sieve of Eratosthenes consistently outperforms the Sundaram method [4].

It works by estimating a value and then refining it through successive iterations until the desired accuracy is achieved [5]. Each iteration produces a better approximation than the previous one [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-step algorithm:**\n",
    "1. **Start with a guess**: Begin with an approximate value for the square root\n",
    "2. **Apply the formula**: Use the formula: **y = 1/2(x+a/x)**\n",

    "Pardeshi et al. highlight both advantages and disadvantages of Heron's method, citing limitations regarding p-adic numbers (alternative number systems based on prime number divisibility patterns), while acknowledging its effectiveness within appropriate numerical domains [5]. The research specifically compares calculated values between an experimental method created by Pardeshi et al. and Heron's formula, finding no significant difference in first-iteration results but documenting error differences in second and third iterations [5]. This analysis shows that the Heron method's ability to provide continual iterative improvement is a distinction that demonstrates the algorithm's value in square root calculation despite its ancient origins.\n",

    "  * It applies Heron's method (`0.5 * (x + currentPrime / x)`) to get a better approximation.\n",
    "  * It checks for convergence by comparing the difference between approximations using [`abs()`.](https://chatgpt.com/share/68175959-9b90-800f-a24a-fb7ad9ed775e)\n",
    "  * It updates `x` with the new approximation for the next iteration.\n",
    "* For each prime, once convergence is reached, it extracts only the fractional part by [subtracting the integer portion.](https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-extract-the-fractional-part-of-a-float-number-in-python)\n",
    "* The fractional part is then converted to its binary representation by:\n",

    "Proof of Work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism originally introduced in the [Bitcoin whitepaper by Nakamoto](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) as a system to implement verification across peer networks [6]. PoW creates a transaction record that becomes difficult for attackers to modify when honest participants control most processing power [6]. It timestamps transactions through a continuous hash-based chain, forming an immutable record [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental principle involves finding values that, when hashed with SHA-256, produce hashes beginning with a specific number of zeros [6]. Bitcoin implements this using SHA-256 hashing to find specific patterns [6]. The system works by incrementing a counter value within each block until it finds a value that produces a hash with the required leading zeros [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational requirements grow exponentially for each zero bit required [6]. The counter value incrementation represents a trial-and-error approach that is inherently random due to cryptographic hash function properties [6].\n",
    "The PoW system uses computing power as a form of voting in the network [6]. The valid version of the blockchain is simply the longest chain, as it represents the greatest computational investment [6]. Miners show they accept valid blocks by using their computers to build on top of them, and they reject fake blocks by refusing to build on them [6].\n",

    "The function shown below, `findWordsWithMaxLeadingZeros`, implements an algorithm to find words that produce hash values with the maximum number of leading zeros, which aligns with the fundamental principle of Proof of Work (PoW) used in Bitcoin and other blockchain systems.\n",

    "* First, it initializes variables to track the maximum number of leading zeros found and a list to store words with this property.\n",

    "* For each word, it utilizes [`hashlib.sha256()`](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/computational_theory/blob/main/materials/hash_functions.ipynb) with [`.encode()`](https://chatgpt.com/share/6817712f-a818-800f-862b-014d9c8a783e) and [`.digest()`](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/computational_theory/blob/main/materials/hash_functions.ipynb) to calculate a SHA256 hash.\n",
    "* The function then analyzes each byte in the hash digest, counting leading zeros in two ways:\n",
    "  * Full-byte zeros using equality comparison and incrementing by 8\n",
    "  * Bit-by-bit counting using a [list comprehension](https://sqlpad.io/tutorial/python-enumerate/#:~:text=When%20you%20combine%20enumerate%20with,from%20another%20list%20or%20iterable) with `next()`: `leadingZeros += next((i for i, bit in enumerate(byteBin) if bit == '1'), 8)` which locates the position of the first '1' bit in the binary representation.\n",
    "* It then checks if a word produces a hash with more leading zeros than previously found, updating the maximum and resetting the list by using `[(word, digest.hex(), leadingZeros)]` to\n",
    "* If a word matches the current maximum, it's added to the list.\n",

By creating a controlled test environment with a temporary file containing just this word, the test confirms the algorithm's accuracy in identifying and quantifying these properties. The test serves as validation that the cryptolinguistic phenomenon being studied is reproducible and measurable, establishing a baseline for what constitutes a significant cryptographic property in natural language words.\n",

    "# Task 7: Turing Machines\n",
    "At its essence, a Turing machine operates as an abstract automaton that executes computations through a series of discrete steps. It consists of a control unit with a finite number of internal states, a tape of unlimited length for input/output and memory, and a read/write head that accesses one tape cell at a time. For each computational step, the machine examines the current symbol under the head, consults its transition table to determine its next action based on both this symbol and its current state, then writes a new symbol, moves the head, and potentially changes its internal state. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of addOneTuringMachine is grounded in Alan Turing's foundational 1937 paper, which describes the essential components needed for binary addition, establishing the theoretical framework that makes this operation possible. Our method utilizes what Turing defined as the core components: a finite set of \"m-configurations\" (states) represented by our add and carry states, the infinite \"tape\" divided into \"squares\" for storing our binary digits, and the ability to read and write \"symbols\" (0 and 1) on each position. The method follows Turing's principle that computational tasks can be broken down into simple operations-moving left or right, reading symbols, and changing states-which together implement the step-by-step process of binary addition. As noted in the paper, a Turing machine designed to add 1 to a binary number is possible because standard arithmetic operations fall within the scope of what Turing machines can compute, demonstrating how Turing's universal model can be applied to specific arithmetic operations.\n",

    "# Task 8: Computational Complexity\n",
    "Bubble sort is one of the oldest and simplest sorting algorithms that works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they're in the wrong order. This process causes larger values to \"bubble\" to the end of the list with each complete pass, hence the name \"bubble sort.\" The algorithm completes when no swaps are needed during a pass, indicating the list is fully sorted. Despite its simplicity, it is among the most inefficient for real-world applications. This thorough research by Omar Khan Durrani and Sayed AbdulHayan from Ghousia College of Engineering and P A College of Engineering respectively involved asymptotic analysis of various sorting algorithms implemented in Python and Java. Bubble sort operates with a general time complexity of O(n²) and best-case complexity of O(n), requiring only O(1) auxiliary space. Performance measurements on random data samples in Python revealed extremely poor efficiency at scale, with sorting 100,000 elements taking 748.49 seconds. For worst-case scenarios (already sorted data), the algorithm performed even worse, requiring approximately 1748.8 seconds (about 195 minutes) to process 500,000 elements. The study confirmed bubble sort belongs to the \"too slow\" O(n²) category of algorithms, exhibiting substantial performance degradation as dataset sizes increase, validating its O(n²) complexity for large inputs.\n",
