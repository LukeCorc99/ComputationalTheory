    "# Task 1: Binary Representations\n",
    "Manipulating binary representations is done as part of the **Secure Hash Standard (SHS)** algorithms [1]. The [National Institute of Standards and Technology (2015)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) note that the primary reason for these manipulations is to generate 'digests' of messages, which are condensed representations of electronic data [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary function of generating message digests is to verify if messages have remained unaltered since the time the digests were originally created [1]. The algorithms specified in the Standard allow for the identification of the message’s integrity [1]. This occurs because any modification to the message will almost certainly produce a different digest [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **manipulation of binary representations** is the fundamental mechanism by which these hash algorithms operate. The hash computation process involves iteratively generating a series of hash values using a message schedule, functions, constants, and word operations [1]. These word operations are specifically defined binary manipulations that operate on fixed-size groups of bits called \"words\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific operations used to manipulate the binary representations of words include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bitwise logical word operations:** AND, OR, XOR, and complement.\n",
    "- **Addition modulo 2^w:** Where 'w' is the word size (32 or 64 bits, depending on the specific SHA algorithm). This operation is defined by adding the integer values represented by the words and taking the remainder modulo 2^w.\n",
    "- **Left-shift operation (<<):** Obtained by discarding bits furthest to the left and padding with zeros on the right.\n",
    "- **Right-shift operation (>> or SHR n (x)):** Obtained by discarding bits furthest to the right and padding with zeros on the left.\n",
    "- **Rotate operations (ROTR/ROTL):** For circular shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These binary manipulations are defined within the functions used by the algorithms, such as the Ch, Maj, Sigma0, and sigma0 functions for SHA-224 and SHA-256, which combine bitwise logic, shifts, and rotations [1].\n",
    "Beyond message integrity, the characteristic where any modification to the message produces a different digest can also facilitate digital signature creation and validation, message authentication code verification, and random number generation [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "The following functions introduce binary operations used in Secure Hash Standard algorithms for message digest creation, providing implementations of the bit manipulation operations that form the foundation of cryptographic hash functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function 1: rotl(x, n=1) (Left Rotation)\n",
    "The **ROTL (Rotate Left)** operation is fundamental in the SHA-1 algorithm and represents a circular left shift [1]. It performs a shift of x by n positions to the left. The `rotl` function defined below performs a left rotation on a 32-bit unsigned integer. Left rotation shifts bits to the left by `n` positions, wrapping around the bits that overflow beyond the 32-bit boundary. This implementation uses [bitwise shift operators (`<<` and `>>`)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python3-program-to-rotate-bits-of-a-number/) to perform the rotation, combining the left shift with a right shift of the remaining bits.\n",

    "**Manipulating hash values** is done as part of hash table lookup algorithms [2]. [Kernighan and Ritchie (1988)](https://www.cimat.mx/ciencia_para_jovenes/bachillerato/libros/%5BKernighan-Ritchie%5DThe_C_Programming_Language.pdf) provide an implementation of an algorithm which functions as a hash-search, converting a word into a positive integer (hash value) [2].\n",
    "The primary function of this algorithm is to allow for searching within hash tables by using the generated integer as an index [2]. The algorithm serves as the basis for Java's [hashCode()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-string-hashcode-method-with-examples/), which is used to return a String's hash value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `hash` function defined below is a Python version of Kernighan and Ritchie's algorithm, which works by iteratively processing each character in the input string and combining it with previously processed characters in a way that distributes values evenly across the hash table. \n",
    "- [The algorithm uses 31 as a multiplier](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/why-does-javas-hashcode-in-string-use-31-as-a-multiplier/) due to its nature as a prime number, which creates different distributions of keys in the array. When using a prime multiplier, the same key (e.g. \"DEV\") would generate different hash values (e.g. D31 + E31 + V*31) compared to using a non-prime multiplier (e.g. 30), resulting in better distribution of values across the hash table. \n",
    "- [101 is used as the modulo value](https://www.designgurus.io/answers/detail/why-should-hash-functions-use-a-prime-number-modulus) for the hash function because it constrains the output to a fixed range (0-100) that can be directly used as an index in a hash table of size 101. As a prime, 101 has no common factors with other numbers except 1, allowing hash values to spread evenly across all buckets (array slots where elements with the same hash value are stored) rather than clustering in predictable patterns. This helps to reduce collisions and improve overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `hash` function initializes a hash value at 0 and loops through each character of the input string. Using [`ord()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord), each character is converted to an integer, multiplied by 31, and combined with the current hash value. The result is reduced to a fixed range using the modulo operator (101).\n",

    "3. **Begin with 2**: Start with the first prime number, which is 2.\n",

    "4. **Mark multiples as non-prime**: Cross out all multiples of 2 (4, 6, 8, etc.) in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Move to next unmarked number**: The next unmarked number (3) is now the new prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Repeat the process**: Mark all multiples of 3 as non-prime (6, 9, 12, etc.).\n",

The comparative analysis shows that performance varies based on the size of numbers being evaluated [4]. For smaller ranges of numbers, the Sieve of Sundaram demonstrates better performance characteristics than the Sieve of Eratosthenes [4]. However, as the quantity of prime numbers increases or when dealing with larger number ranges, the Sieve of Eratosthenes consistently outperforms the Sundaram method [4]. This performance advantage makes the Eratosthenes algorithm better suited for applications requiring the identification of large prime numbers or when generating extensive sets of primes.\n",

    "4. **Process all number pairs**: Check all combinations of numbers to mark those that should be excluded.\n",

It works by estimating a value and then refining it through successive iterations until the desired accuracy is achieved [5]. Each iteration produces a better approximation than the previous one [5].\n",

The research specifically compares calculated values between an experimental method created by Pardeshi et al. and Heron's formula, finding no significant difference in first-iteration results but documenting error differences in second and third iterations [5]. This analysis shows that the Heron method's ability to provide continual iterative improvement is a distinction that demonstrates the algorithm's value in square root calculation despite its ancient origins.\n",

    "  * It updates `x` with the new approximation for the next iteration.\n",

    "**Proof of Work (PoW)** is a consensus mechanism originally introduced in the [Bitcoin whitepaper by Nakamoto](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) as a system to implement verification across peer networks [6]. PoW creates a transaction record that becomes difficult for attackers to modify when honest participants control most processing power [6]. It timestamps transactions through a continuous hash-based chain, forming an immutable record [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental principle involves finding values that, when hashed with SHA-256, produce hashes beginning with a specific number of zeros [6]. Bitcoin implements this using SHA-256 hashing to find specific patterns [6]. The system works by incrementing a counter value within each block until it finds a value that produces a hash with the required leading zeros [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational requirements grow exponentially for each zero bit required [6]. The counter value incrementation represents a trial-and-error approach that is inherently random due to cryptographic hash function properties [6].\n",
    "The PoW system uses computing power as a form of voting in the network [6]. The valid version of the blockchain is simply the longest chain, as it represents the greatest computational investment [6]. Miners show they accept valid blocks by using their computers to build on top of them, and they reject fake blocks by refusing to build on them [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "The function shown below, `findWordsWithMaxLeadingZeros()`, implements an algorithm to find words that produce hash values with the maximum number of leading zeros, which aligns with the fundamental principle of Proof of Work (PoW) used in Bitcoin and other blockchain systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, it initializes variables to track the maximum number of leading zeros found and a list to store words with this property.\n",
    "* Then, it opens and reads a text file (`words.txt`) containing words, processing only alphabetic lines using the [list comprehension](https://python-course.eu/advanced-python/list-comprehension.php?#:~:text=List%20comprehension%20is%20an%20elegant,filter()%20and%20reduce().): `[line.strip().lower() for line in file if line.strip().isalpha()]` which simultaneously strips whitespace, converts to lowercase, and filters for alphabetic content.\n",
    "* For each word, it utilizes [`hashlib.sha256()`](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/computational_theory/blob/main/materials/hash_functions.ipynb) with [`.encode()`](https://chatgpt.com/share/6817712f-a818-800f-862b-014d9c8a783e) and [`.digest()`](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/computational_theory/blob/main/materials/hash_functions.ipynb) to calculate a SHA256 hash.\n",
    "* The function then analyzes each byte in the hash digest, counting leading zeros in two ways:\n",
    "  * Full-byte zeros using equality comparison and incrementing by 8\n",
    "  * Bit-by-bit counting using a [list comprehension](https://sqlpad.io/tutorial/python-enumerate/#:~:text=When%20you%20combine%20enumerate%20with,from%20another%20list%20or%20iterable) with `next()`: `leadingZeros += next((i for i, bit in enumerate(byteBin) if bit == '1'), 8)` which locates the position of the first '1' bit in the binary representation.\n",
    "* It then checks if a word produces a hash with more leading zeros than previously found, updating the maximum and resetting the list by using `[(word,` [`digest.hex(),`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_hex.asp) `leadingZeros)]` to create a tuple containing the word, its hash, and zero count in a single entry when updating the best words list.\n",

    "A [**Turing machine**](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~halorenz/4students/Literatur/TuringFullText.pdf) is a mathematical model of computation consisting of a tape divided into squares that can hold symbols, with a scanning mechanism that reads one square at a time[7]. The machine operates through distinct states (called m-configurations) and can perform basic operations: writing or erasing symbols on the current square, and moving one square left or right [7]. These simple operations are determined entirely by the current state and scanned symbol [7]. When designed to print binary digits (0 and 1), it becomes capable of calculating numbers through limited means [7].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Turing machines serve as the foundation for modern computer science by providing an understanding of computation at its most fundamental level. They provide a definition of which numbers are computable and were originally used by Turing to prove the impossibility of the Entscheidungsproblem - the problem asking whether there exists a general algorithm that can determine if any given mathematical statement is provable within a specific system [7]. Most importantly, Turing described a \"universal computing machine\" capable of simulating any other computing machine when given its description [7], essentially inventing the concept of computers. Turing's work established a fundamental understanding of the limits of mechanical calculation methods and what can be algorithmically computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `addOneTuringMachine` function demonstrates a practical application of Turing machines by implementing binary addition of 1, showing how simple operations can be performed using state transitions and symbol manipulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The function initializes by converting the input to a [list of characters](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/computational_theory/blob/main/materials/turing_machines.ipynb) and setting the head position to the element furthest to the right.\n",
    "* It then enters a loop that reads symbols and applies transition rules based on the current state and symbol:\n",
    "    * If the head moves past the position furthest to the left, it inserts a `1` at the beginning using [`insert()`](https://dev.to/ra1nbow1/8-ways-to-add-an-element-to-the-beginning-of-a-list-and-string-in-python-925#:~:text=Method%201%3A%20insert&text=The%20insert()%20method%20takes,as%20the%20first%20parameter%201%20.).\n",

    "    * In `\"carry\"` state with a `0`, it writes `1` and terminates. If in `\"carry\"` state with a `1`, it continues carrying by writing `0` and moving left.\n",

    "**Bubble sort** is described by [Durrani and AbdulHayan (2022)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9988424) as the oldest and simplest data sorting algorithm [8]. The basic process of bubble sort involves examining pairs of neighboring elements in a dataset and switching their positions when they're out of order [8]. This swapping causes larger values to gradually rise toward the end of the list while smaller values naturally move toward the beginning - similar to how bubbles float up in water and heavier objects sink down [8]. Bubble sort stands out for its ease of use and integration, but its computational efficiency deteriorates quadratically as dataset size increases, rendering it unsuitable for processing large amounts of data [8].\n",

    "Durrani and AbdulHayan examine bubble sort in comparison to alternative sorting techniques [8]. They note that while it is valuable as an educational tool for introducing fundamental computer science concepts, bubble sort's practical utility decreases significantly when processing larger information sets [8]. Their analysis contrasts bubble sort's efficiency against more advanced methods such as insertion and selection algorithms [8].\n",

    "From a computational complexity perspective, bubble sort exhibits its optimal performance of O(n) when processing sorted lists [8]. In the worst-case scenario, when data is arranged in reverse order, the algorithm's efficiency deteriorates greatly [8]. The average-case performance operates at O(n^2) time complexity, while maintaining a consistent O(1) space requirement regardless of input size [8].\n",
