    "# Task 1: Binary Representations\n",
    "Manipulating binary representations is done as part of the **Secure Hash Standard (SHS)** algorithms [1]. The [National Institute of Standards and Technology (2015)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) note that the primary reason for these manipulations is to generate 'digests' of messages, which are condensed representations of electronic data [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary function of generating message digests is to verify if messages have remained unaltered since the time the digests were originally created [1]. The algorithms specified in the Standard allow for the identification of the message’s integrity [1]. This occurs because any modification to the message will almost certainly produce a different digest [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **manipulation of binary representations** is the fundamental mechanism by which these hash algorithms operate. The hash computation process involves iteratively generating a series of hash values using a message schedule, functions, constants, and word operations [1]. These word operations are specifically defined binary manipulations that operate on fixed-size groups of bits called \"words\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific operations used to manipulate the binary representations of words include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bitwise logical word operations:** AND, OR, XOR, and complement.\n",
    "- **Addition modulo 2^w:** Where 'w' is the word size (32 or 64 bits, depending on the specific SHA algorithm). This operation is defined by adding the integer values represented by the words and taking the remainder modulo 2^w.\n",
    "- **Left-shift operation (<<):** Obtained by discarding leftmost bits and padding with zeros on the right.\n",
    "- **Right-shift operation (>> or SHR n (x)):** Obtained by discarding rightmost bits and padding with zeros on the left.\n",
    "- **Rotate operations (ROTR/ROTL):** For circular shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These binary manipulations are defined within the functions used by the algorithms, such as the Ch, Maj, Sigma0, and sigma0 functions for SHA-224 and SHA-256, which combine bitwise logic, shifts, and rotations [1].\n",
    "Beyond message integrity, the characteristic where any modification to the message produces a different digest can also facilitate digital signature creation and validation, message authentication code verification, and random number generation [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "The following functions introduce binary operations used in Secure Hash Standard algorithms for message digest creation, providing implementations of the bit manipulation operations that form the foundation of cryptographic hash functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function 1: rotl(x, n=1) (Left Rotation)\n",
    "The ROTL (Rotate Left) operation is fundamental in the SHA-1 algorithm and represents a circular left shift [1]. It performs a shift of x by n positions to the left. The `rotl` function defined below performs a left rotation on a 32-bit unsigned integer. Left rotation shifts bits to the left by `n` positions, wrapping around the bits that overflow beyond the 32-bit boundary. This implementation uses [bitwise shift operators (`<<` and `>>`)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python3-program-to-rotate-bits-of-a-number/) to perform the rotation, combining the left shift with a right shift of the remaining bits.\n",

    "Manipulating hash values is done as part of hash table lookup algorithms [2]. [Kernighan and Ritchie (1988)](https://www.cimat.mx/ciencia_para_jovenes/bachillerato/libros/%5BKernighan-Ritchie%5DThe_C_Programming_Language.pdf) provide an implementation of an algorithm which provides a hash-search, converting a word into a positive integer (hash value) [2].\n",
    "The primary function of this algorithm is to allow for searching within hash tables by using the generated integer as an index [2]. The algorithm serves as the basis for Java's [hashCode()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-string-hashcode-method-with-examples/), which is used to return a String's hash value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `hash` function defined below is a Python version of Kernighan and Ritchie's algorithm, which works by iteratively processing each character in the input string and combining it with previously processed characters in a way that distributes values evenly across the hash table. \n",
    "- [The algorithm uses 31 as a multiplier](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/why-does-javas-hashcode-in-string-use-31-as-a-multiplier/) due to its nature as a prime number, which creates different distributions of keys in the array. When using a prime multiplier, the same key (e.g. \"DEV\") would generate different hash values (e.g. D31 + E31 + V*31) compared to using a non-prime multiplier (e.g. 30), resulting in better distribution of values across the hash table. \n",
    "- [101 is used as the modulo value](https://www.designgurus.io/answers/detail/why-should-hash-functions-use-a-prime-number-modulus) for the hash function because it constrains the output to a fixed range (0-100) that can be directly used as an index in a hash table of size 101. As a prime, 101 has no common factors with other numbers except 1, allowing hash values to spread evenly across all buckets (array slots where elements with the same hash value are stored) rather than clustering in predictable patterns. This helps to reduce collisions and improve overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `hash` function initializes a hash value at 0 and loops through each character of the input string. Using [ord()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord), each character is converted to an integer, multiplied by 31, and combined with the current hash value. The result is reduced to a fixed range using the modulo operator (101).\n",

    "Padding is one of three preprocessing steps in the SHA-256 algorithm, alongside parsing and setting initial hash values, with its fundamental purpose being to ensure the message's total length is a multiple of 512 bits for processing in 512-bit blocks. The padding process appends a specific sequence: first a single '1' bit, followed by k zero bits (where k is the smallest non-negative integer solution to λ + 1 + k ≡ 448 mod 512), and finally a 64-bit block representing the original message length (λ) in binary using big-endian convention, which can represent integers from 0 to 2⁶⁴-1. After padding is applied, the message length becomes a multiple of 512 bits, with the standard noting that padding can be inserted either before hash computation begins or during computation prior to processing blocks containing the padding - a flexibility introduced in FIPS 180-4 compared to the previous FIPS 180-3 version. This padding method applies identically to SHA-1, SHA-224, and SHA-256, with the constraint that the original message length must be less than 2⁶⁴ bits."

    "## 1. Trial Division\n",
    "Trial division is described as the most straightforward method for determining whether a given number n (where n > 1) is prime or composite. The method involves testing the number n for divisibility by integers in sequence, starting with 2, then 3, 4, and so on. The procedure doesn't need to continue indefinitely; it can be stopped as soon as the trial divisor exceeds the square root of n. This shortcut significantly speeds up the test. The reasoning is that factors always come in pairs; if a number has a factor larger than its square root, it must simultaneously have one that is smaller. Other simple shortcuts include deleting all even trial divisors after 2. If n is composite, the trial division procedure will terminate by finding a divisor that divides n evenly (leaves no remainder). The divisor found and the corresponding quotient are factors of the number. Multiplying these factors produces n, and this output serves as a certificate of compositeness for n. If n is prime, trial division will proceed up to √(n) without finding any divisors. However, this method does not provide a certificate of primality if the number is found to be prime."

    "This test demonstrates the square root optimization in the trial division algorithm for finding prime numbers. It selects six prime numbers of increasing size (2, 3, 7, 19, 47, 101) and measures how many divisibility checks are performed for each one. The test visually confirms that the number of checks required grows proportionally to the square root of the number being tested, not linearly with the number itself. This efficiency is shown by comparing the actual checks performed (which follow the square root curve) against the theoretical maximum checks without optimization (n-1). For example, checking if 101 is prime requires only 9 checks (roughly equal to its square root of 10.05) instead of 100 checks, demonstrating a dramatic performance improvement that becomes increasingly significant as numbers get larger."

    "The Sieve of Eratosthenes, discovered by ancient Greek scientist Eratosthenes, is considered the simplest algorithm for generating prime numbers between 1 and a given number n by systematically eliminating non-prime numbers from a collection. The process follows specific steps: starting with numbers from 2 to n (list A), marking 2 as prime and moving it to list B, deleting all multiples of 2 from list A, then repeatedly finding the next unmarked number (which is prime), moving it to list B, and removing all its multiples from list A until no numbers remain. This method efficiently identifies primes (as demonstrated with numbers 1-100, yielding 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.), and has applications in cryptographic algorithms. Performance comparisons show that while the Sieve of Sundaram is better for small prime numbers, the Sieve of Eratosthenes proves more efficient for generating large prime numbers, as evidenced by experiments conducted using a Java application with code optimization and buffer memory usage, with results displayed in a comparative table and graph.\n",

    "# Task 6: Proof of Work\n",
    "The Python implementation presents a novel intersection of cryptography and linguistics by examining how standard English words perform in a computational puzzle framework. Responding directly to the task of identifying words with maximum leading zero bits in their SHA256 hash digests, this algorithm systematically evaluates dictionary entries as cryptographic inputs. Through bit-level analysis of hash outputs, the code quantifies a property that would otherwise remain hidden in the seemingly random distribution of hash values. Escobar's research on Proof of Work systems explores similar cryptographic principles, though in the context of blockchain mining where difficulty is defined by the number of leading zeros in hashes produced from incremental nonce adjustments. While Escobar examines this process in cryptocurrency applications, the current implementation applies the concept to natural language, creating what could be termed a \"linguistic hash difficulty\" measurement. The discovery that \"goaltenders\" produces a hash with 18 leading zeros represents an interesting cryptographic property that emerges when applying hash functions to everyday words-demonstrating how computational methods can reveal unexpected patterns in the relationship between natural language and cryptographic transformations.\n",

    "This test implements the core algorithm to identify English words with the maximum number of leading zero bits in their SHA256 hash digests. The function systematically examines each word from a dictionary file, calculating its SHA256 hash and meticulously counting the leading zeros both at the byte level and the bit level within partially zero bytes. This precise counting method allows the algorithm to identify words with cryptographic properties that would remain hidden using less granular approaches. The test demonstrates how natural language can be evaluated through computational cryptography, creating a bridge between linguistics and hash-based proof of work systems.\n",

    "# Task 7: Turing Machines\n",
    "At its essence, a Turing machine operates as an abstract automaton that executes computations through a series of discrete steps. It consists of a control unit with a finite number of internal states, a tape of unlimited length for input/output and memory, and a read/write head that accesses one tape cell at a time. For each computational step, the machine examines the current symbol under the head, consults its transition table to determine its next action based on both this symbol and its current state, then writes a new symbol, moves the head, and potentially changes its internal state. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of addOneTuringMachine is grounded in Alan Turing's foundational 1937 paper, which describes the essential components needed for binary addition, establishing the theoretical framework that makes this operation possible. Our method utilizes what Turing defined as the core components: a finite set of \"m-configurations\" (states) represented by our add and carry states, the infinite \"tape\" divided into \"squares\" for storing our binary digits, and the ability to read and write \"symbols\" (0 and 1) on each position. The method follows Turing's principle that computational tasks can be broken down into simple operations-moving left or right, reading symbols, and changing states-which together implement the step-by-step process of binary addition. As noted in the paper, a Turing machine designed to add 1 to a binary number is possible because standard arithmetic operations fall within the scope of what Turing machines can compute, demonstrating how Turing's universal model can be applied to specific arithmetic operations.\n",

    "# Task 8: Computational Complexity\n",
    "Bubble sort is one of the oldest and simplest sorting algorithms that works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they're in the wrong order. This process causes larger values to \"bubble\" to the end of the list with each complete pass, hence the name \"bubble sort.\" The algorithm completes when no swaps are needed during a pass, indicating the list is fully sorted. Despite its simplicity, it is among the most inefficient for real-world applications. This thorough research by Omar Khan Durrani and Sayed AbdulHayan from Ghousia College of Engineering and P A College of Engineering respectively involved asymptotic analysis of various sorting algorithms implemented in Python and Java. Bubble sort operates with a general time complexity of O(n²) and best-case complexity of O(n), requiring only O(1) auxiliary space. Performance measurements on random data samples in Python revealed extremely poor efficiency at scale, with sorting 100,000 elements taking 748.49 seconds. For worst-case scenarios (already sorted data), the algorithm performed even worse, requiring approximately 1748.8 seconds (about 195 minutes) to process 500,000 elements. The study confirmed bubble sort belongs to the \"too slow\" O(n²) category of algorithms, exhibiting substantial performance degradation as dataset sizes increase, validating its O(n²) complexity for large inputs.\n",
