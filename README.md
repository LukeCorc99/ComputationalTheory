## Installation

In order to install the **Computational Theory** project on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Install Visual Studio Code**
   Make sure that Visual Studio Code is installed on your machine.
   - Go to the Visual Studio Code download page.
   - Download the Windows installer (.exe).
   - Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.
   Once installed, you can launch Visual Studio Code either normally or by typing `code .` in your terminal (after ensuring it is added to your PATH).

2. **Clone the repository:**
   Open your Command Line Interface and clone the project to your machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/g00410404/ComputationalTheory.git
   ```
3. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```
   cd path/to/the/project
   ```
4. **Open Visual Studio Code via Project Directory**
   ```
   code .
   ```
5. **Install Python:**
   -  Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the left-hand side.
   -  Search for "Python" in the Extensions view and install the Python extension published by Microsoft.

6. **Install the required dependencies for Jupyter Notebook:**
   Run the following command to install Jupyter Notebook and other relevant dependencies required:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. **Start the application:**
   After installing the extensions, you can open .ipynb files directly. Just navigate to the notebook file in your project VS Code and click on it to open.

   
## Usage

Simply navigate to tasks.ipynb and hit **'Run All'.** This will execute all code cells, demonstrating the functionality of the implementation of each task.


## Features
The project includes the following features:

**- Feature 1: Binary Representations**

Implement bitwise operations such as rotation, majority voting, and conditional selection.

**- Feature 2: Hash Functions**

Convert and analyze a hash function from C to Python, discussing numerical choices in hashing.

**- Feature 3: SHA256 Padding**

Compute and display SHA256 message padding as per the Secure Hash Standard (FIPS 180-4).

**- Feature 4: Prime Number Calculation**

Compute the first 100 prime numbers using different algorithms.

**- Feature 5: Roots Calculation**

Compute the fractional parts of square roots of the first 100 prime numbers.

**- Feature 6: Proof of Work Challenge**

Find English words with the highest leading zero bits in their SHA256 hash.

**- Feature 7: Turing Machines**

Design a Turing Machine that increments a binary number.

**- Feature 8: Computational Complexity**

Implement bubble sort while counting comparisons for different permutations.
